//! libraries ==>
// ? collection of functions : a library provides reusable functions and modules to perform specific task
//? you call the library functions when needed
//? example : react (JS), jQuery (Js), etc....

//! frameworks ==>
//? full structure : a framework provides a complete structure to build applications
//? here the framework calls your code when needed (inversion of control)
//? less flexibility : frameworks structure and patterns are fixed
//? example : Express (NodeJS), Angular(ReactJS), etc....

//! simple analogy --> a library is like a tool box, you can use the tools when needed ,
//! a framework is like a car, you can drive it but you can't change the internal structure

// example --> execute my code >> register >> submit >>routing>> controller >> model >> database

//! frameworks are always preferred for building any projects because we don't have to write our code from scratch and we can use the pre-built code

//! Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js --> ExpressJS
// it handles the routing part only, if we want to implement any other feature or functionality then we have to use middlewares (special feature of expressJS)

//Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
